# Unify

### Introduction
In todayâ€™s virtual world, messaging/chatting is the most commonly used mode of communication for interacting with each other. Various mobile applications have been continuously enhancing themselves to improve the user experience and improve the usability of chat applications. Most often, random and anonymous people can send an entirely irrelevant message and breach the privacy of the user.
To solve this problem, I have created an application called unify, which helps the user to maintain a closed list of people who are in their phone contact list such that the user can send/receive messages to/from the people who belong to their contact list. Thus, this application increases the security of the user messages.

### Features
The following are the features of this application:

* Registering a new user
* Login to the account
* Fetch contacts from the phone
* Displaying the existing users of this app from the contact list
* Mesasging the existing users
* Display of the list of users with whom the currecnt users had a chat

* Firebase Database
